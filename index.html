          so my name is marwan halfaya im a final year student at the faculty of comerce at suez universty and my journey with programing 
          started a while ago i had a friend who was a computer science student six years ago and i was intrested to start codeing so 
          he gave me a course to start with it was a c++ course i started it and then got distracted and i forgot all about programing for a while 
        </p>

        <p>fast forward six years and another friend of mine started a didital marketing scolarship as an initive from the ministry
          of comunication and Udacity and i saw an online ad for the same course and remembered i was intrested in programming

        <h2>Section 3</h2>
        <p>for the third section lets talk about the last book i read  </p>

        <p>im nearly out of ideas to write but i will try to keep thinking for the sake of completing 
          four sections and be done with this part for good so im gonna add a part from the song of achelis
          “You are destroying yourself. You will not be loved for this, you will be
          hated, and cursed. Please, if you—”
          “Patroclus.” The word was sharp, as he had never spoken it. His eyes bore
          down on me, his voice like the judge’s sentence. “I will not do this. Do not
          ask again.”
          I stared at him, straight as a spear stabbing the sky. I could not find the
          words that would reach him. Perhaps there were none. The gray sand, the
          gray sky, and my mouth, parched and bare. It felt like the end of all things. He
          would not fight. The men would die, and his honor with it. No mitigation, no
          mercy. Yet, still, my mind scrabbled in its corners, desperate, hoping to find
          the thing that might soften him.

    <section id="section4" data-nav="Section 4">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Section 4</h2>
        <p>and for this last section more of the song of Achelis 
          Nothing moves in the tent; time does not seem to pass. Then Achilles
          stands. “It is close to dawn, and I do not want you to be in danger as you
          travel home. I will have my servants prepare your son’s body.”
          WHEN THEY ARE GONE, he slumps next to me, his face against my belly. My
          skin grows slippery under the steady fall of his tears.
          The next day he carries me to the pyre. Briseis and the Myrmidons watch
          as he places me on the wood and strikes the flint. The flames surround me,
          and I feel myself slipping further from life, thinning to only the faintest shiver
          in the air. I yearn for the darkness and silence of the underworld, where I can
          rest.
          He collects my ashes himself, though this is a woman’s duty. He puts them
          in a golden urn, the finest in our camp, and turns to the watching Greeks.
          “When I am dead, I charge you to mingle our ashes and bury us together.”
        </p>

        <p>Achilles hears the faint hum of its passage a second before it strikes. He
          turns his head a little, as if to watch it come. He closes his eyes and feels its
          point push through his skin, parting thick muscle, worming its way past the
          interlacing fingers of his ribs. There, at last, is his heart. Blood spills between
          shoulder blades, dark and slick as oil. Achilles smiles as his face strikes the
          earth.
